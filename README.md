# MQTT Controlled Device 

As a part of my engineering thesis I've created control system for mobile robot. Project has been written in Python and is designed to be set up on Raspberry Pi. Main functions of the system:
* Engines control - DC engines and servos.
* Measurements of environment (dangerous gases and WiFi signal strength).
* MQTT messages exchange with application.
* Handling all tasks in parallel
